Text editor based on [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com) that performs various functions as follows:

* Display text.
* Search text for a user-input phrase.
* Search for a user-input phrase and replace it.
  * Following this, allow the user to save text as a new file.
* List the most common words seen in the text.
* Find and list all palindromes.
* Find and list all individual words which are palindromes.
* List all email addresses found in the text.
* Show the secret message in the text.
  * Secret message is encoded as mid-word upper case characters.
  * Secret message uses Caesar Cipher with shift 13.

## Installation

Make sure you have [Python 3.10 or higher](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed.

Clone the repository to your directory of choice. If you use [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) you can follow these commands in order:

```sh
cd [path/to/directory]
```

```sh
git clone https://github.com/PetervdHemel/docuworksProject.git
```

---
Next up, create and activate a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) (venv):

```sh
python -m venv venv
```

**OS X and Linux**

```sh
./venv/bin/activate
```

```sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

**Windows**

```sh
.\venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

```sh
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run the Application

Finally, run the main.py app as a local server using [uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org):

```sh
uvicorn main:app
```

Make sure to run this in the same directory as where you installed the program.
You can now access the functions of the program through your localhost network from your browser, eg:

```str
http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
```

You can check out this page for the API documentation, generated by [SwaggerDocs](https://swagger.io/docs/) automatically with FastAPI.
